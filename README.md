Place to collaborate on the DevOpd project
## List of goals:
###	Tech is easy people are hard (Culture Change) 

* In order to facilitate culture to change, I must create small “wins” in automation, then publicize it though demonstration and training as much as I can to try and spread the change. The cultural shift must occur at all levels including the senior management – How Sr. Mgmt. will adapt to interact and support the new culture can be taught through training sessions or table top exercises.

* Settle on a common tool set that integrates easily with tools developers currently use.

* Document current state and pain points, create a strategic plan.

###	How to boil the ocean (Implement DevOps CI/CD)

* Plan for small projects that we can demonstrate to Dev teams and Managers to support #1 goal.

* Look for opportunities to automate processes that are redundant or time consuming for potential pilot projects.

* Plan for Short term, Medium term and long term goals, and document our path(confluence project/Kanban?)

* Some “manual” interventions may still be needed. Stack manual processes based on mission, cost, and political capital to prioritize which manual process can be automated and which ones will need to be accepted for today and undergo future review.

###	Use peer pressure of tool adoption (Common Tools, processes, and Standards) 

* Once more dev teams adopt the CI/CD tools and approach there will be pressure to bring the more conservative teams on board.

* It’s easier to seek forgiveness than ask for permission or get concurrence.(a little scary here, but the point is understood)

* Strive for one repository one set of metrics. ( there can’t be multiple ground truths)
  
    * Key factor: Centralize the Dev/Test/deploy capabilities as much as possible
